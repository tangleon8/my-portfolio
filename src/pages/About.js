          <p>
            I am currently pursuing a combined B.S./M.S. in Information Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), with an expected graduation date of May 2026.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, thanks for visiting my website portfolio! My name is Leon Tang, and I'm a senior at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). I currently work as a Cybersecurity Analyst Intern at Textron Systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduation, my goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst or engineer, helping organizations protect their critical assets. I also plan to pursue a Master's degree and an MBA‚Äîand perhaps even a Ph.D. one day. My long-term aspiration is to become a Chief Security Officer (CSO), and eventually a motivational speaker to inspire others to chase their dreams and support those less fortunate.
